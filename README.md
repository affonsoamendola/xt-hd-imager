# xt-hd-imager
Project for a hard drive imaging software for the IBM-XT and compatibles (mainly the Brazillian Nexus 2600)

I dont think I'll keep working on this, it was really fun tho!

It did its purpose and I managed to recover the entire disk from the Nexus 2600 I have access to, did'nt test it yet with an actual XT but when I do get my hands on one I'll post something here.
